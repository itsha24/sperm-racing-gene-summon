# 💦 Sperm Racing — Gene Summon (Gacha Mode)

> “We made sperm racing addictive — Gene Summon Mode, where your swimmers become collectible heroes.”

## 🧠 Inspiration
We wanted to take the hilarious *Sperm Racing* concept and make it **unforgettable**.  
So we asked: *What if biology had a gacha system?*  
The result — **Gene Summon Mode** — turns real sperm racing data into collectible cards, mixing parody, science, and game design.

## 🎮 What It Does
Gene Summon is a **gacha-style feature** for the Sperm Racing app.  
Players open **Gene Capsules** to summon unique sperm racers — each with:
- Randomized **stats** (Speed, Focus, Endurance, Chaos)  
- **Rarity tiers** (Common → Legendary)  
- Funny **names and lore**  
- Stored in your personal **Spermdex** collection  

The experience feels cinematic, inspired by *Genshin Impact*’s summon animation — but with a bio-sci-fi twist.

## ⚙️ How We Built It
**Frontend:** React + Vite + Framer Motion for smooth animation and UI polish  
**Backend:** Node.js + Express generating random stats and rarities  
**(Optional Integration):** Ties into the [Nature sperm motility dataset](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02173-4) to generate stat distributions  
**Styling:** Clean, glassmorphism-inspired design with a sci-fi DNA lab theme  

## 🧫 Challenges We Ran Into
- Balancing humor and polish — making it funny but still clean and demoable  
- Getting animations to feel cinematic and fluid without overcomplicating logic  
- Finding the right tone between parody and professionalism  

## 💡 What We Learned
- How to use **Framer Motion** to design real gacha-style effects  
- How to tie **scientific data** into creative, game-like experiences  
- That humor + polish = memorability in hackathon projects  

## 🚀 What’s Next
- Integrate **real sperm motility data** to drive in-game stat generation  
- Connect with the real **Sperm Racing app** for performance-based capsule rewards  
- Add **Fusion Lab** and **AR reveal mode** for evolving sperm heroes  
- Deploy live demo via Vercel + Render
